  For the plan of 2021, firstly should be the graduation in December. The graduation is the most important plan in 2021. After that, I am preparing the CPA exam for August. Considering I'm not the accounting program student, I am trying to pass the 3/6 exams of the base level in 2021.Finally, I wish to get two intern experience to learn more stuffs in working. Especially the different area that I have never touched.
  Above is the study and working plan. For my own life and body, I wish to control my sleeping time and loss weight.
